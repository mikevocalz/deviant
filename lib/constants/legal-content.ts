    subtitle: "A Protected Digital Space for Black & Brown LGBTQ+ Community",
    lastUpdated: "January 2026",
    content: `DVNT (Members Only Platform) was created to provide a safe, affirming, and culturally grounded digital home for Black and Brown LGBTQ+ people. For more than a decade, Deviant LLC and Counter Culture Society have built in-person spaces rooted in joy, safety, creativity, and collective care. DVNT extends that mission into the digital world.

Our community model is intentional: DVNT is a members-only platform, accessible first to individuals who have attended our LIVE events — real people who have shown up and participated in our community in person. This ensures a safer, human-only space centered on the lived experiences, cultural expressions, and shared histories of Black and Brown LGBTQ+ people.

DVNT is not an open social network. It's a protected cultural ecosystem. A care-driven space designed by and for people who deserve digital spaces that honor their identity, autonomy, and brilliance.

DVNT welcomes aligned allies who share our commitment to culture, consent, and collective safety.

## Protected Space Statement

DVNT exists to provide a protected online environment for individuals who participate in the culture, community, and real-world gatherings organized by Deviant LLC and Counter Culture Society. Our mission is to cultivate a safer digital ecosystem that supports, uplifts, and reflects the lived experiences of Black and Brown LGBTQ+ communities and the people who show up for and within these spaces.

DVNT does not exclude individuals on the basis of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or any protected class. Instead, DVNT's model is rooted in community participation and verified membership, ensuring that DVNT is populated by real individuals who have engaged with our LIVE events, values, and cultural initiatives.

Through this intentional membership model, DVNT fosters:

• A safer digital experience, free from bots, impersonation, and harassment
• Reduced exposure to harmful online behavior
• A community grounded in shared culture, spaces, and histories
• Authentic representation of the people who co-create our physical and digital community

DVNT is a protective, culturally responsive space — built not by exclusion, but through access granted by genuine participation.`,
