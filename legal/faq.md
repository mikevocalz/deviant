# Frequently Asked Questions

**DVNT: A safer, human-only space for Black & Brown LGBTQ+ community.**

## General

### What is DVNT?

DVNT is a free, members-only platform built for Black & Brown LGBTQ+ people. It's a safe, affirming community focused on culture, connection, and care.

### Who operates DVNT?

DVNT is operated by Deviant LLC and Counter Culture Society (the "Deviant Entities").

### Who can join DVNT?

DVNT is strictly for adults 18+ who agree to DVNT's Verification Requirements, Community Standards, and Terms of Service.

### How does DVNT enforce that the platform is for Queer POC?

During the beta phase, DVNT uses a closed-access model limited to individuals who have attended our LIVE events. Over the past decade, Deviant LLC and Counter Culture Society have built a verified community of more than 78,000 real people who've attended in-person nightlife, cultural, and community events.

Every attendee signs in using their name, email, and phone number, and this data allows DVNT to authenticate members during account creation. This approach ensures:

- 100% real humans (no bots, trolls, or burner accounts)
- People we've already engaged with in real physical spaces
- A community of individuals who already show up for Black & Brown LGBTQ+ events
- Higher trust, reduced harm, and increased safety
